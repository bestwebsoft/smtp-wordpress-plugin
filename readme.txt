== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is my email not sent? =

Please make sure that the data specified on the plugin settings page is correct. In case you are using such mail services as Gmail, Yahoo, or other, you need to contact your mail service support team to get the correct settings.

= I've adjusted the settings the right way, and yet the email messages still fail to be sent =

Please try sending a test email, having marked a "Display log" checkbox. You will then see a log, in which you can find the bug that triggers sending failures.

= On the plugin settings page, I see 'Not Confirmed' in the Settings Status block. Why? =

To confirm that the settings are correct, you need to send a test email first. When the test email is sent successfully, please click "Settings are Correct" button.
