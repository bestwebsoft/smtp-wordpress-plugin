Please make sure that the data specified on the plugin settings page is correct. In case you are using such mail services as Gmail, Yahoo, or other, you need to contact your mail service support team to get the correct settings. 

= I've adjusted the settings the right way, and yet the email messages still fail to be sent =
 
Please try sending a test email, having marked a "Display log" checkbox. You will then see a log, in which you can find the bug that triggers sending failures.
